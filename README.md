# üöÄ JCBLiveLink Microservices: Powering Seamless Connectivity
Welcome to the JCBLiveLink Microservices repository! This project forms the backbone of our robust and scalable application, designed to deliver exceptional user experiences.

## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Overview
We've embraced a microservices architecture to ensure agility, maintainability, and independent scaling of our services. Here's a glimpse into the key components:

* **JCB-Common-API-Customer:** The foundation of our microservices ecosystem, housing shared code and configurations.
* **JCB-API-Gateway:** Your single point of entry! The API gateway intelligently routes requests to the appropriate microservices.
* **JCB-Authentication & JCB-Mobile-Authentication:**  Securing your data is paramount. These services handle user authentication and authorization across platforms.
* **JCB-Service-Registry (Eureka):**  Facilitating seamless communication, Eureka acts as our service discovery and registration hub.
* **JCB-User:**  Everything about our users in one place! This service manages user data and related operations.
* **JCB-Machines:**  Connecting the physical and digital, this service manages machine data and interactions.

##  ‚ú® Key Features
* **Independent Deployable:**  Each microservice can be deployed and scaled independently, enabling rapid development and deployment cycles.
* **Technology Agnostic:**  Built on RESTful APIs, our services can seamlessly integrate with various technologies and platforms.
* **Enhanced Scalability:**  Effortlessly handle growing demands by scaling individual services as needed.
* **Improved Fault Tolerance:**  Isolate failures and ensure the application remains operational even if one service encounters issues.
